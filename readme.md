## Release Notes

### 0.1.0

A basic set up of backend content input and frontend markup building functions. The point is so that a backend input field is not set, then they HTML used to display that value on the frontend is fully ommitted from the mark up so that no extra markup remains on the page if it is not in use.

As of now there is no archive page tempate.

## Dependancies
This plugin uses the [CMB2 framework](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2) for custom metaboxes and input field generation.
